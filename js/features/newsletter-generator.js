    // ==================== HOME MAINTENANCE & CARE (Prevent Costly Surprises) ====================
    "Home Maintenance & Care: Winter Gutter Check — Frozen gutters cause ice dams that damage roofs and siding—thousands in repairs. After the next thaw, clear debris from gutters/downspouts. Use a leaf blower extension from the ground if ladders aren’t your thing. Works great in IN, OH, MI, and KY.",
    "Home Maintenance & Care: Change HVAC Filters Every 60-90 Days — Dirty filters raise energy bills 5-15% and shorten system life. Buy a 6-pack and swap them out regularly for better air quality and lower bills from Duke, NIPSCO, AEP, DTE, or Consumers Energy.",

    "Home Maintenance & Care: Test Garage Door Auto-Reverse — Place a broom under the door. If it doesn’t reverse, adjust or call a pro — safety first.",
    "Home Maintenance & Care: Clean Gutters in Fall AND Spring — Leaves in fall, pollen and seeds in spring. Prevents blockages and ice dams.",

    // PREVIOUS UNWRAP APPROACH (replacing the table with its raw <tr><td> contents) broke table nesting.
    // Bare rows injected into the padded <td> caused parsers (Outlook, vault iframe) to mis-nest, making the green

    // - Only strip the *constraining* max-width + margin:0 auto from *its style* so it fills the card's padded area.
    // - Strip align="center" from the layout table itself (so it doesn't narrow itself).
    // Result: the self-contained green-bordered thumbnail table only frames the picture. The button row follows it
    // cleanly *under* the video (in the next <tr> of the layout table), and centers via its own child <td align="center">.
